    <h1>CHAPTERS OF SELF-HELP</h1>

    <p><strong>Breaking free from self-destructive emotional programs</strong></p>

    <p>The human subconscious is full of programs that direct behavior and choices in life.</p>

    <p>They are programs collected from father, mother, childhood, and elsewhere throughout life.</p>

    <p>Some of them are positive, but the majority are usually negative. We are aware of some, but most guide us without our knowledge.</p>

    <p>It is these hidden subconscious programs that direct a person’s behavior and choices when interacting with others or reacting to situations.</p>

    <p>Negative programs lead to self-destructive behavior or the generation of self-destructive energy.</p>

    <p>The first step is to uncover and become aware of these programs.</p>

    <p>Once you become conscious of them, you can begin to cleanse the subconscious and overwrite the negative programs.</p>

    <p>You cannot simply delete them, because that would leave an empty space. Instead, you must always replace the negative one with a new, positive program.</p>

    <p>For example: during communication, someone’s words or behavior do not meet your expectations, triggering the emotion of offense in you.</p>

    <p>Every person is like a radio station that constantly generates energy with their thoughts, words, and emotions and broadcasts it.</p>

    <p>Others pick up on this energy when they interact with that person, or even from the other side of the world just thinking about them.</p>

    <p>The energy field produced by a person is strongest around them; they live within their own field.</p>

    <p>The energy of offense is negative and destructive. It causes bad feelings, breaks down organic matter, and creates disease.</p>

    <p>The goal is to overwrite the negative offense program.</p>

    <p>When your partner’s words or behavior do not meet your expectations, you consciously choose not to feel offended and instead adopt understanding.</p>

    <p>You see and understand why they said and acted that way, because they too are driven by negative subconscious programs. They are not to blame; they simply lack awareness, and therefore you can forgive them.</p>

    <p>Now that you are aware, you can consciously choose a reaction that suits you, improves your well-being, and heals your body.</p>

    <p>We are all, in a spiritual sense, children. You must bring yourself to the level of communicating with a child.</p>

    <p>When a small child’s words or behavior do not meet your expectations, you usually do not take offense; you smile, forgive them, and respond with love.</p>

    <p>In the same way, you must now interact with adults.</p>

    <p>Negative energy repels, and positive energy attracts.</p>

    <p>If you constantly generate and inhabit a negative energy field, others will subconsciously avoid you. They feel they dislike you and do not want to be with or interact with you.</p>

    <p>But if you generate and inhabit positive energy, everyone will want to interact and befriend you, because positive energy attracts.</p>

    <p>The most repelling energy is that of depression and despair, and the most attractive is the energy of joy and zest for life.</p>
