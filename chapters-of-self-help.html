    <h1>CHAPTERS OF SELF-HELP</h1>
    <h2>BREAKING FREE FROM SELF-DESTRUCTIVE EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS</h2>

    <p>Human subconscious is filled with programs that steer our behavior and choices throughout life.</p>
    <p>These programs originate from parents, childhood experiences, and other influences we collect over time.</p>
    <p>Some of them are positive, but the majority are usually negative. We are aware of some, yet most guide us without our conscious knowledge.</p>
    <p>These hidden subconscious programs direct a person’s behavior and choices when interacting with others or reacting to situations.</p>
    <p>Negative programs lead to self-destructive behavior or the generation of self-destructive energy.</p>
    <p>The first step is to uncover and become aware of these programs.</p>
    <p>Once you become conscious of them, you can begin to cleanse the subconscious and overwrite the negative programs.</p>
    <p>You cannot simply delete them, because that would leave an empty space. Instead, you must always replace the negative one with a new, positive program.</p>
    <p>For example: during communication, someone’s words or behavior do not meet your expectations, triggering the emotion of offense in you.</p>
    <p>Every person is like a radio station that constantly generates energy with their thoughts, words, and emotions and broadcasts it.</p>
    <p>Others pick up on this energy when they interact with that person, or even from the other side of the world just by thinking about them.</p>
    <p>A person’s energy field is strongest around themselves; they live within the field they create.</p>
    <p>Offense energy is negative and destructive—it causes ill-feeling, breaks down organic matter, and creates disease.</p>
    <p>The goal is to overwrite the negative offense program.</p>
    <p>If someone’s words or behavior don’t meet your expectations, consciously choose understanding instead of offense.</p>
    <p>You see why they said and did what they did, because they too act under their own negative subconscious programming. They aren’t at fault—they simply aren’t aware—so you can forgive them.</p>
    <p>Now that you are aware, you can choose a response that improves your well-being and heals your body.</p>
    <p>We are all spiritual children. Meet adults at the level of a child’s communication:</p>
    <p>If a toddler’s words or behavior don’t meet your expectations, you usually don’t get offended. You smile, forgive them, and respond with love.</p>
    <p>In the same way, now begin to interact with adults.</p>
    <p>Negative energy repels, while positive energy attracts.</p>
    <p>If you constantly generate and dwell in negativity, others sense it and subconsciously keep their distance.</p>
    <p>But if you generate and inhabit positive energy, everyone will want to talk and connect with you—positive energy draws them in.</p>
    <p>Despair and hopelessness push people away most; joy of life attracts them most.</p>
