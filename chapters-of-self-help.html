    <h1>CHAPTERS OF SELF-HELP</h1>
    <h2>BREAKING FREE FROM SELF-DESTRUCTIVE EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS</h2>

    <p>The human subconscious is filled with programs that guide a person’s behavior and choices in life.</p>
    <p>These are programs gathered from one’s father, mother, childhood, and other life experiences.</p>
    <p>Some of them are positive, but the majority are usually negative. Some we are aware of, but most guide us without our knowledge.</p>
    <p>It is precisely these hidden subconscious programs that influence a person’s actions and decisions in interactions with others or when reacting to situations.</p>
    <p><strong>Negative programs lead to self-destructive behavior or the generation of self-destructive energy.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The first step is to identify these programs and become aware of them.</strong></p>
    <p>Once aware, you can begin to cleanse the subconscious and start overwriting negative programs.</p>
    <p>These programs cannot simply be deleted, as that would leave an empty space. Therefore, a new and positive program must always replace the negative one. This new program can be consciously created and written into the subconscious.</p>
    <p><strong>Negative programs trigger negative emotions, and negative emotion is destructive and harmful.</strong></p>
    <p>Negative emotions include offense, disappointment, anger, shame, rage, hatred, contempt, superiority, resentment, depression, fear, and similar states.</p>
    <p>For example, when interacting with someone and their words or behavior do not please you or meet your expectations, it triggers the emotion of offense within you. This is negative energy that the offended person begins to produce and radiate outward.</p>
    <p><strong>The one who suffers most is the offended person, as they must dwell within this negative energy. But everyone near them is also harmed.</strong></p>
    <p>Negative energy breaks down all living things—it causes disease and destroys or degrades organic matter.</p>
    <p>Every person is like a radio station, constantly generating energy through their thoughts, words, and emotions, and radiating it outward.</p>
    <p>This energy is sensed by others who interact with that person—or even by someone thinking of them from across the world.</p>
    <p>A person’s generated energy field is strongest around themselves—they live within the energy field they create.</p>
    <p>Those with a strong positive energy field around them cannot be harmed by negative energy.</p>
    <p><strong>Negative energy repels, and positive energy attracts.</strong></p>
    <p>People subconsciously begin to avoid someone with a negative energy field, because they feel the destructive effect of this energy. Negative energy pushes others away.</p>
    <p>But those who produce positive energy attract everyone—people want to interact with them and be their friends, because this energy heals, uplifts, and restores. Positive energy begins to draw others in.</p>
    <p>The energy of depression and despair repels the most; the energy of joy attracts the most.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal is to first become aware of the programs that trigger your negative emotions, and then overwrite them.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, if your communication partner’s words or actions do not meet your expectations, you should consciously choose understanding instead of offense.</p>
    <p>See and understand why they said or did what they did. They too have subconscious programs that drive them to express and behave the way they do. People are not aware of this—or they do not consciously realize it.</p>
    <p><strong>The key is forgiveness—«forgive them».</strong></p>
    <p>Now that you are aware and capable of consciously choosing the reaction that suits you, your well-being will improve, and your body will heal along with it.</p>
    <p><strong>One helpful method is child-field communication.</strong></p>
    <p>We are all spiritually children, and in difficult relationships, one should try to bring themselves to the level of communicating with a child.</p>
    <p>Think about it: if a small child’s words or actions do not meet an adult’s expectations, a normal adult doesn’t take offense. Instead, they smile, forgive the child, and respond with love.</p>
    <p>Likewise, adults do not get angry with animals but forgive them when they do «something wrong».</p>
    <p>If this same attitude is applied between adults, then the emotional programs that generate negative feelings can be released.</p>
